# Security and privacy considerations

AI Foundry Local is designed with privacy and security as core principles:

- **Local processing**: All data processed by AI Foundry Local remains on your device and is never sent to Microsoft or any external services.
- **No telemetry**: AI Foundry Local does not collect usage data or model inputs.
- **Air-gapped environments**: AI Foundry Local can be used in disconnected environments after initial model download.

## Security best practices

- Use AI Foundry Local in environments that align with your organization's security policies.
- For handling sensitive data, ensure your device meets your organization's security requirements.
- Consider disk encryption for devices where cached models might contain sensitive fine-tuning data.

## Licensing considerations

Models available through AI Foundry Local are subject to their original licenses:

- Open-source models maintain their original licenses (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT).
- Commercial models may have specific usage restrictions or require separate licensing.
- Always review the licensing information for each model before deploying in production.
